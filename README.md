## üìÑ Abstract  
Extreme precipitation events in the South America Andean Region are defined as periods where standard precipitation thresholds are abruptly exceeded. Timely forecasting of these events is crucial for urban planning, water research, and climate-related institutions. This study proposes a data-driven approach to classify and anticipate extreme precipitation events using hydroclimate features.  

The methodology involves:  
1. **Pre-processing**: Preparing precipitation-related time series data.  
2. **Feature Selection**: Applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Regressional Relief (RR), and a cascade approach combining both.  
3. **Classification**: Using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to detect extreme precipitation events.  

Results demonstrate the effectiveness of feature selection and classification for precipitation event detection, with PCA showing superior performance in two- and three-class problems.
